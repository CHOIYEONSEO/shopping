# Welcome to the Shopping Expo app üëã

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

0. Crate `.env` file or set `EXPO_PUBLIC_PC_LOCAL_IP` variable in `.env`

   <br/>

   if you want to find `EXPO_PUBLIC_PC_LOCAL_IP`,

   in cmd

   ```bash
   ipconfig
   ```

   <br/>

   then, find IPv4 address (ex. `190.X.X.X`) and set its value to the `EXPO_PUBLIC_PC_LOCAL_IP` variable.

   ```bash
   #.env
   EXPO_PUBLIC_PC_LOCAL_IP=190.X.X.X
   ```

   > ‚ö†Ô∏è Do not enter `;` at the end

   <br/>

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   <br/>

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   # default, for android studio
   npx expo start
   ```

   ```bash
   # for expo go
   npx expo start --go --tunnel
   ```

   <br/>

   after change `.env` or if you have to remove cache, using `-c` option

   ```bash
   npx expo start -c

   or

   npx expo start --go --tunnel -c
   ```

   <br/>

3. Start the json-server
   ```bash
   npm run mock
   ```
   <br/>
